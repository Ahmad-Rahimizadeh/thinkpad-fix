I have used this laptop.

It's somewhat wonky because I'll put it to sleep only for it to come back up again. The trackpad will sometimes lockup or not work at all until a reboot.

I have made a systemd unit file to help with the sleeping issue if it happens to you. I have experienced this on Ubuntu, not Arch though.

Place this in /etc/systemd/system/tp-yoga-wakeup.service



[Unit]
Description=ThinkPad Yoga Wakeup Service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "echo XHC > /proc/acpi/wakeup"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target




Then run sudo systemctl enable tp-yoga-wakeup.service for it to start across reboots.
